        <p>The Sweet Tooth Fairy Bakery was established in the late 1990s by Rebecca Jonosky. The bakery is situated on the Irene Farm in Centurion,
         the farm is open to the public. It is a amazing property,family-friendly and an educational destination with 120 years of rich history. 
        The bakery boasts about it's own rich history, with settlers and alot of people moving through towns, the farm was their first stop to visit the bakery.
        People came to get some fresh cakes and fill the bakery with their warmth.
      </p>
      <p>Most people who was moving pass came to test the milk,eggs,butter,cheese,flour etc from the farm in all our warm baked goods from our breads,buns,scones or cheesy croissants
         to our milkshakes and warm beverages.
        The farm was always a hotspot for new people from all over the world, starting from only Mrs Jonosky it grew to a family business with everyone of her 12 children
        lending their hands to keep up with the amount of clients coming in daily.

      <p>Mrs Jonosky's husband was an Evangelist and with there being a church on the farm, they could spend more time together.There were many days he had 
        to go out of town to preach the gospel and he trusted she would always provide him with love homecooked and baked goodies, he enjoyed her cappuccino flavoured
        pancakes before heading out the most. She also baked amazing treats for the church and had bake sales at church ensuring everyone was supplied with their koeksisters 
        before church as well.She believes her bakery has thrived over the years because her special ingredient was God always.

      <p>The bakery decided to adopt a more hands on approah more recently, under management of one of the granddaughters of Mr and Mrs Jonosky. They partnered with the Irene Farm owners,
        whom they had a very lovely connection with for the ultimate experience of going through the process of milking cows and sorting eggs for clients who want to get involved with making
        their baked goodies from scratch scratch. After gathering all the freshly harvested ingredients on the farm the clients can then clean up and get down and dirty in the kitchen baking
        with Mrs Jonosky's supervision and expertise, thus making it a more fun and educational experience for both the clients and the bakers at the bakery.Yes ,with so many tourists coming in and 
        having access to a variety of farm produce, the tourist come in to bake and actually share their recipes with the bakery too!
